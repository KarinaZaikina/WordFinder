When we think of the whole of modern London, the capital city of England and the United Kingdom, 
that great area covering several hundred square kilometres, we do not think of it as 'a city. 
not even as a city and its suburbs. 
Modem London is not one city that has steadily become larger through the centuries; 
it is a number of cities. towns, and villages that have, during the past centuries, 
grown together to make one vast urban area.
London is situated upon both banks of the River Thames, 
it is the largest city in Britain and one of the largest in the world. 
Its population is about 7 million people.
London dominates the life of Britain. It is the chief port of the country and 
the most important commercial, manufacturing and cultural centre. 
There is little heavy industry in London, but there is a wide range of light industry in Greater London.
